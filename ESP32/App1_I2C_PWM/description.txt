# Overview
A small embedded aplication for reading the temperature value from a I2C temperature sensor and adjust pwm parameters based on that temperature value.

## phase 1 (cuurent):
adjust ledc pwm duty cycle based on temperature.
for the pwm frequency the idf docs' recomendation was followed and a frequency of 5kHz was choosen.
the 5kHz freq. gives us a 2**13 = 8192 resolution steps.
has to make the changes more noticible the intervals for conversion of the temperature value into a duty cycle were:
temperature: [20 - 30[
with each ÂºC being a 200 step in the duty cycle.
formula: (temperature-20) * 200;
additionally, when temperature is above 23, an LED in GPIO 12 will turn on


## phase 2:
create a mcpwm sigal based on temperature.
