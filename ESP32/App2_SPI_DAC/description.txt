The DAC converts digital signals into analog and sends them to the ESP32. The ESP32 sends these values to the EEPROM through the SPI.

While writing to the eeprom the app ligth up a LED in GPIO 25.

Note:

The SPI part of the app isnt fully functional even when using other colegues work for the eeprom driver.
