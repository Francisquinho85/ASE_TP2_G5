In this application the ADC is being used to read signals from a potentiometer. These signals are calculated to be transformed into voltage to send them to the UART. The UART1 writes and the UART2 reads and sends these values to be displayed in the terminal. Also, power management has been implemented. When the last value read by the ADC is equal to the previous one, the ESP32 will enter a light sleep mode for 3 seconds.
