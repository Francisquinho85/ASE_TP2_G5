In this application the ADC is being used to read signals from a potentiometer. The readings have 12 bits.
These 12 bits are calculated to be transformed into voltage to be used by the UART. There are 2 UART1 tasks.
The UART1_TX task is responsible for writing the voltage values in a buffer and the UART1_RX is responsible 
for reading these values to be displayed in the terminal. Also, power management has been implemented. 
When the last value read by the ADC has a 5mV difference comparing to the previous value, the ESP32 will 
enter in a light sleep mode for 3 seconds. This will trigger a GPIO which is connected to an LED to 
turn it off while it is in sleep mode.
